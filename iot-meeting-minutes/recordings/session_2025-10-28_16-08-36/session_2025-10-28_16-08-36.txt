============================================================

[00:00:14] some are working on another project so my basic feel that everything can be represented in computers and computer can't replace your mind
[00:00:32] the main building block of it as building on your network that can understand like human brain but what happens is that day to day life most of people don't understand how to use biggest using it
[00:00:34] but the of
[00:00:37] yeah it's far more than that
[00:00:40] predicting day life to controlling it
[00:00:43] making it better
[00:00:46] the yeah will take us to a level there
[00:00:50] people who can make things hard for us
[00:01:01] the main thing that gets us power than the real question will happen stroke that was legal to
[00:01:05] well let me talk about that age
[00:01:13] just we are not very close but we are certainly close to what is
[00:01:17] correction of a human brain a computer much
[00:01:20] more faster much more better and efficient
[00:01:25] a label and can be transferred that can have a lot of memories
[00:01:26] performance basis
[00:01:30] so what i wanted to make this
[00:01:35] to make a needle lot of us
[00:01:47] computational power what actually is that train the data is one thing but making sense is another part of training at the first is trying that second insurance
[00:01:51] and third is running and generating answer
[00:01:54] model just understand that
[00:01:59] everything but what i'm proposing there
[00:02:06] i will use the randomness of universe to make this possible
[00:02:10] what is that lose the string theory
[00:02:15] of and relativity for make this happen
[00:02:17] la forma dynamics
[00:02:19] and
[00:02:24] this is far more capable than address
[00:02:26] quantum technology
[00:02:29] superficial speed
[00:02:30] this
[00:02:33] but that
[00:02:37] it can do a lot of more stuff that's normal
[00:02:48] the basic things where we are lacking is the computational power that is also we are able to do using like it's one hundred
[00:02:52] of and videos performance of these
[00:03:13] increasing day by day so the competition expensive thing can be done in less time on all the cube it's well known that quantum computer as microsoft has so they have make their wasn't of quantum computers that have a lot of power than other traditional computational power so they can do a lot of
[00:03:15] stuff that
[00:03:18] what you want to do is that
[00:03:22] technology for betterment of society
[00:03:27] right now we are a lot of things that are not making sense but by the time
[00:03:36] it will become great so we can visit is the coming age is going to be ruled by a board
[00:03:39] robots and stuff like that
[00:03:45] there is a person for me if you are into these then start working right now
[00:03:50] much time either so that more and also when
[00:03:53] he should learn like a child
[00:03:56] robert
[00:04:00] of its talk about something interesting
[00:04:05] like how of human brain walk the consciousness
[00:04:12] how is not just random of chaos
[00:04:17] whatever happens in universe is part of world
[00:04:20] part of us
[00:04:25] maybe more than that murder was
[00:04:28] let's talk about something else
[00:04:32] i'll talk about how
[00:04:37] medical
[00:04:44] i am too much about changing technology
[00:04:51] most people don't do it for sake of earning money and all but i want to do it for changing the ground breaking varieties
[00:04:57] my aim is very how i want to do it on time
[00:04:59] so you make short
[00:05:05] i can do it and do it that's the most thing
[00:05:10] okay i think the sector is fine
[00:05:12] talk about
[00:05:14] so thank you bye
[00:05:19] okay let's stop move i want to see the capacity of this rewarding
[00:05:21] for the
[00:05:24] this fuss about some another topic
[00:05:27] so how's
[00:05:30] okay this fuss about politics
[00:05:34] all politics is always fall
[00:05:39] because of the way people assume at nothing
[00:05:52] oh and let's talk about geopolitics and how the world changed with how america and all the world's know
[00:05:57] fucking the global economy right now from you all know about it that day
[00:06:07] so much tariff on other countries because of they want to feel superior than others
[00:06:14] whatever they want but you're fifty sixty years that should get this always change
[00:06:25] no longer the number one countries china will become and eventually there were also and just go and declined because of nice things
[00:06:27] i've heard about
[00:06:29] so that will happen with them
[00:06:31] hope
[00:06:36] things happen and two yours and we can do that
[00:06:42] capitalize it by using our people
[00:06:49] rather than just building services for them build products for everyone
[00:06:53] your service based companies and all
[00:06:55] but that's not the time
[00:07:02] the product or company from the world that the world
[00:07:07] the genetic
[00:07:19] biotech will disrupt the market rather than just for dealing with this small service thanks and all these things are really automated right
[00:07:21] and also
[00:07:26] crucial role of person who have done research and work on it
[00:07:30] far more valuable than just have a degree and so
[00:07:38] super main objective is to make mine that can comprehend this all
[00:07:46] let's talk about some more interesting thing so i think what i can think of area
[00:07:49] so let's talk about
[00:07:52] how global warming
[00:08:01] government works on a basic principle of demand and supply have no
[00:08:09] what is that these demand and supply artificially created for some kind of are some kind of stress
[00:08:14] some kind of other third party activities which happen every day
[00:08:23] these are influenced by a lot of powerful people that they of from shadows
[00:08:27] you must think that
[00:08:35] tickets are also some conspiracy theories but i do believe that it's not just visa
[00:08:39] and all of us
[00:08:41] okay
[00:08:43] so what
[00:08:48] the time
[00:08:50] much better than the
[00:09:00] next final
[00:09:05] edit
[00:09:10] if you are
[00:09:23] so what is that i will deploy all the models on my raspberry pi
[00:09:33] work offline and decentralize happen on my local device that the main motive of making devices
[00:09:36] so i've almost
[00:09:42] for six and eight seconds that close to ten minutes and i would like to pause
[00:09:45] i am running out of thoughts
[00:09:47] but
[00:09:50] or something
[00:09:51] i forget
[00:09:55] what do you know exactly what isn't
[00:09:56] others
[00:10:03] i was very bad from school time
[00:10:09] i try to for some that in the college still not on the top
[00:10:14] so thank you
